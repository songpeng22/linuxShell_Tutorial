The syntax is as follows for bash, ksh, zsh, and all other shells to read a file line by line
while read -r line; do COMMAND; done < input.file
The -r option passed to read command prevents backslash escapes from being interpreted.
abc \n 
def
   
    
Add IFS= option before read command to prevent leading/trailing whitespace from being trimmed -
while IFS= read -r line; do COMMAND_on $line; done < input.file
